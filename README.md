Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has contributed significantly to human health, yet safety concerns remain a primary limitation to its development, particularly as the frequency and severity of spontaneously reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have increased in recent years due to complex ingredients and unclear mechanisms of action. 
While previous studies have predominantly focused on the overall safety of specific TCMs, research into individual ingredient safety remains limited. 
This study developed a novel risk prediction model (TIRPCR) that integrates causal reasoning and deep learning to predict drug-related risks of individual TCM ingredients. 
Based on 36,948 spontaneous ADR reports from Jiangsu Province, China (2017-2023), the TIRPCR model simulates randomized controlled trials from real-world data, employs inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to mitigate confounding factors, and utilizes long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to predict drug risks across major organ systems. 
Results revealed that 12 TCM ingredients carry gastrointestinal ADR risks, 10 ingredients pose risks to skin and subcutaneous tissue, and 8 ingredients present nervous system ADR risks, while demonstrating exceptional capability in balancing confounding factors. 
The proposed TIRPCR model can effectively predict ADRs of single TCM ingredients by simulating randomized controlled trials using spontaneous reports, providing valuable risk guidance for drug design and development.
